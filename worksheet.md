*Arr, me hearties. In this resource ye will create a web page which can translate normal English text into pirate speak, usin' jQuery and regularrr expressions.*

## Create a web page

1. Open up a blank file in your chosen text editor and save the file as follows:

 -  If you're using **Notepad** on Windows, type in the filename as `index.html` and also change the drop-down for the 'Save as' type to *All files*.

 - If you're using **TextEdit** on Mac OS, open a new file, then select `Format` > `Make Plain Text`.

  Make sure you save the file as `index.html`.

 - If you're using **Nano** on a Raspberry Pi, open a terminal window, move to the directory you wish to create your web page in, and type `nano index.html`.

 - If you're using [CodePen](http://codepen.io), simply open up a new pen, then **skip steps 2 and 3**.


2. This HTML code gives you the basic structure of a page. Copy and paste the code into the file you created, then save the file.

  ```html
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>My page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    My content here
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

3. Go to the folder where you saved your web page. Open the file with your internet browser, so now you'll have the same file open in both your text editor and your browser at the same time.

  On Windows, you may need to right-click the file, choose `Open with`, and then select your internet browser.

  Whenever you change the code in your text editor, save it and then press the refresh button on your browser to see the page update.
